# Desafio Sinqia

1. Implement User Validation:
  Develop and test a user validation component to 
ensure that the input data provided by users is valid and secure.
2. Create Dependency Injection Service:
  Implement a dependency injection service to allow 
system components to be easily injected and swapped, promoting 
loose coupling and testability.
3. Develop Factory Method:
  Create a factory method that encapsulates object 
creation logic, allowing flexibility in creating different types of 
objects as needed.
4. Establish Observation Mechanism:
  Develop an observation mechanism that allows 
observer objects to be automatically notified of changes in the 
state of an observed object, promoting asynchronous 
communication between system components.
5. Implement Singleton Manager:
  Create a singleton manager that ensures only one 
instance of a particular class is created and provides a global 
access point to that instance throughout the system
